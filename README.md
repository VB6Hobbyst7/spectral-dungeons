Spectral Dungeons
=================

Spectral Dungeons started out as a coffeebreak roguelike for the ZX Spectrum. It was soon followed by another game called Escape From Cnossus, and finally by an expanded adaptation in Python, using the curses module. The family resemblance should be obvious if you play them in order.

The first two games were made with [Boriel's ZXBasic compiler](http://www.boriel.com/wiki/en/index.php/ZXBasic) and require a 48K Spectrum to run -- or more likely an emulator. Tomb of the Snake should run out of the box on a Mac or any typical Linux distro.

All games are available at [No Time To Play](http://notimetoplay.org/our-games/) and [on Itch.io](http://claudeb.itch.io/).
